# Project objective
  This project aims to conduct a comprehensive financial market analysis using stock market data sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/stock-market-analysis-data). The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights from historical stock prices, focusing on identifying trends, detecting market anomalies, and developing predictive models for future price forecasting. Leveraging time series analysis techniques, we will explore the dynamic behavior of stock prices and visualize these trends to provide clear and actionable information. Furthermore, the project will delve into the impact of market news on stock prices, seeking to understand the correlation between external events and market fluctuations. The deliverables will include robust data visualizations, accurate predictive models, and an insightful analysis of news impacts, demonstrating proficiency in time series analysis, financial analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling.
